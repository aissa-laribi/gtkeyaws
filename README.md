# gtkeyaws

Bot to get AWS access keys, the purpose is only to avoid repetitive routine tasks. I am doing Labs with ACG and sometimes they do not provide the access keys so I don't want to repeat this task everytime I start a new Lab.

## Prerequisites

**Python 3.7+** <br>
**Time and Selenium modules** installed in your environment. If new to Selenium, checkout the <a href="https://www.selenium.dev/">Documentation<a/><br/>
	
## Usage
	
1) Replace ACCOUNTNUMBER, ACCOUNTUSER, & PASSWORD with your credentials in the gtkeyaws.py file
	
2) Run the following command 	
  
	python3 gtkeyaws.py
